In Plains Cree, the format of the **lemma category** is as follows:

### Nouns

`ND?(A|I)-(1|2|3|4|4w|5|[?]|x)`

**N**oun, optionally **D**ependent, **A**nimate or **I**nanimate.
After the hyphen, the noun class follows.


### Verbs

`V{class}-(n|v|1|2|3|4|5)`

**V**erb, followed by its transitivity, and the animacy of its
arguments. Note, that abbreviations are historical Algonquian
linguistics terminology; Plains Cree verbs can be viewed as
categorized by the quantity (0, 1, or 2) of its animate arguments (its
*valency*). After the hyphen, the verb class follows.

 - VII — verb inanimate    intransitive (0 animate arguments)
 - VAI – verb intransitive animate      (1 animate argument)
 - VTI - verb transitive   inanimate    (1 animate argument)
 - VTA — verb transitive   animate      (2 animate arguments)


### Other

`IPC` — any word that does not inflect.
