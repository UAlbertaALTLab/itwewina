# New language / linguistic todos 

 * example words for about pages
 * kpv <l /> node pos attr needs to be changed up a bit so PoS matches
   up, switch -SG and etc., to another attribute 
 * layout bugs out with mrj because about text is too long
 * mhr/fin - PoS missing from <l /> node, needs to be moved from <pos> node
 * mhr name? likely not the same as mrj

 * go through contexts for sme and sma 
   contexts and dictionarywork.html to get them all
     
     context="mun"          -- v. prs. s1. - (mun) manan
     context="bivttas"      -- adj. attr.  - alit (bivttas)
     context="gápmagat"     -- num. ??     - guovttit (gápmagat)

# sme-nob rules to write

 * attribute: illpl="no" entries -> remove generated illative plural from paradigm
    eahketroađđi
 * attribute: pg="no" -> no paradigm
 * attribute: attr="no" -> show no attr form
 * variants: lg/l/lsub -> show as alternate spelling
 * generation: vmax
 * see also: <l_ref>
         <l pos="CC">dahje</l>
         <l_ref>vai_cc</l_ref>


# TODAY

 * ie8 rendering bug on flag lists in header on main page, but not on about page

 * debug view for language configs, so people can peek at what paradigms
   are to be generated, tag sets, etc., analyzers exist, lexica exist

 * detail view, include generation info in opt+shift+? debug

 * See bugs 
   
 * new wordpress release

 * change cache settings for plugin js in nginx configs, some browsers are
   unwilling to get a new version even when it exists.

 * test remaining browser notes

 * refresh settings button in plugin

 * jspwiki generator for sphinx

 * cakefile include build bookmark.min.js

 * other dictionaries page, listing links to other groups
 
 * autocomplete parse only once per file

 * a little advertising and such for the reader and page with content in specific languages 
   see script in misc/o

   Add text to reader page: "Here are the top websites that people are reading, did you know you can read them too?"

  For privacy concerns, only include top _domains_ not individual pages. Also,
  split these out by language pair used in the lookup. above list is just
  everything in access logs.

## post launch TODOs:

 * bookmark icon for iOS

    /apple-touch-icon-57x57.png 
    /apple-touch-icon-precomposed.png 
    /apple-touch-icon.png 

 * gtweb: certificates

 * translate the mobile bookmark bubble, maybe modify/write one for
   android, where the process is a little more complex
 
 * Link til read i selve ordbok-grensesnittet -- kor?
   -- "Vil du ha oversatt ord i en tekst?" 
   -- "Háliidatgo jorgalahttit sániid teavsttas?"
   -- "Haluatko käännöksen tekstissä esiintyvään sanaan?"

 * autocomplete SoMe variant

## Next:

 * Glossary page explaining each tag part. 

 * mobile menu language variant display (e.g. SoMe vs. Norm)

 * bookmarklet unload on additional click
   
 * word test-list - http://giellatekno.uit.no/doc/dicts/checklist.html

 * dropdown events on mobile are a bit funny for the menu on the
   detailed view, and it is impossible to select a new language pair

 * use logger's own log message formatter

 -- 

 * Once all this is together, optimize memory usage, with specific
   attention to gtlab / gtoahpa, may be a better way to have multiple
   threads/greenlets/etc running while parsing trees into only one
   thread.

   Note: http://blog.pythonisito.com/2012/07/gevent-and-greenlets.html

## Would be nice

 * Makefile: check which FST and lexica are updated on svn up, and then
   automatically rebuild all

 * advanced search form: here we get to have some nerdy linguistic fun.

## Features to develop at some point:

 * Use something other than werkzeug's default cache

 * Maybe should provide an individual process for each language pair?
   Should be easy to split off new processes by pair/endpoint. Note also
   werkzeug DispatcherMiddleware and PathDispatcher:
   http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/patterns/appdispatch/

 * getting near the time to adapt version of lookupserv.py that is checked in
   for actual use. spawn it on process run, so that no one needs to think/worry
   that it exists aside from looking at process hierarchy in htop
