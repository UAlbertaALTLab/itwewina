* need to hide 'more information' link when there isn't actually more information
  - kind of tricky to implement, the easy way might make things slower,
    but a more involved way just takes more thinking

* some tags are too long for the field, but overflow is hidden
  - f.eks.)
      http://localhost:5000/detail/sme/nob/goabbat%20guoibm%C3%A1me.html?no_compounds=true&lemma_match=true

* need to recheck compounds and derivation filtering
  - not working?

  - oahpásmahttit -> oahpásmuvvat

    $ lookup -flags mbTT analyser-dict-gt-norm.xfst

 - but analyser-gt-norm probably has too much output or something to be used currently? 

* autocomplete needs to not collect entries that have til_ref;
  maybe this will be a language-specific setting

* hverandre and other stuff for the detailed view doesn't work


# Misc

 * update reversed to work with new structures -> fin-kpv

 * ie8 rendering bug on flag lists in header on main page, but not on about page

 * detail view, include generation info in opt+shift+? debug

 * See bugs 
   
 * change cache settings for plugin js in nginx configs, some browsers are
   unwilling to get a new version even when it exists.

 * test remaining browser notes

 * refresh settings button in plugin

 * jspwiki generator for sphinx

 * cakefile include build bookmark.min.js

 * other dictionaries page, listing links to other groups
 
 * autocomplete parse only once per file

 * a little advertising and such for the reader and page with content in specific languages 
   see script in misc/o

   Add text to reader page: "Here are the top websites that people are reading, did you know you can read them too?"

  For privacy concerns, only include top _domains_ not individual pages. Also,
  split these out by language pair used in the lookup. above list is just
  everything in access logs.

## post launch TODOs:

 * bookmark icon for iOS

    /apple-touch-icon-57x57-precomposed.png
    /apple-touch-icon-57x57.png 
    /apple-touch-icon-precomposed.png 
    /apple-touch-icon.png 

 * gtweb: certificates

 * translate the mobile bookmark bubble, maybe modify/write one for
   android, where the process is a little more complex
 
 * Link til read i selve ordbok-grensesnittet -- kor?
   -- "Vil du ha oversatt ord i en tekst?" 
   -- "Háliidatgo jorgalahttit sániid teavsttas?"
   -- "Haluatko käännöksen tekstissä esiintyvään sanaan?"

 * autocomplete SoMe variant

## Next:

 * Glossary page explaining each tag part. 

 * mobile menu language variant display (e.g. SoMe vs. Norm)

 * bookmarklet unload on additional click
   
 * word test-list - http://giellatekno.uit.no/doc/dicts/checklist.html

 * dropdown events on mobile are a bit funny for the menu on the
   detailed view, and it is impossible to select a new language pair

 * use logger's own log message formatter

 -- 

 * Once all this is together, optimize memory usage, with specific
   attention to gtlab / gtoahpa, may be a better way to have multiple
   threads/greenlets/etc running while parsing trees into only one
   thread.

   Note: http://blog.pythonisito.com/2012/07/gevent-and-greenlets.html

## Would be nice

 * Makefile: check which FST and lexica are updated on svn up, and then
   automatically rebuild all

 * developer- and linguist-friendly templates for editing how words are
  presented ; multimethods + jinja - prefer more templates instead of many
  if/else statements for attributes?

 * tagsets for selecting POS from analyses & specifying what parts of
   tags should be used for lookups, with fallbacks if they don't exist.
   (i.e., take POS and Valence if both exist in analysis, if only POS, use
   that)

   - sma: +1+V, +2+V; one fix is to remove from FST, so that +V is first
          element, other option would be to improve the lookup system.

   - maybe thinking about a solution to this will help generalise other
     things for more languages, allowing language-specific configuration
     of what elements from the analysis must be used to look up words in
     the lexicon

 * advanced search form: here we get to have some nerdy linguistic fun.

## Features to develop at some point:

 * Use something other than werkzeug's default cache

 * Maybe should provide an individual process for each language pair?
   Should be easy to split off new processes by pair/endpoint. Note also
   werkzeug DispatcherMiddleware and PathDispatcher:
   http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/patterns/appdispatch/

 * getting near the time to adapt version of lookupserv.py that is checked in
   for actual use. spawn it on process run, so that no one needs to think/worry
   that it exists aside from looking at process hierarchy in htop
