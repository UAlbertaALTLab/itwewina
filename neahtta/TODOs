* generalizing SoMe to a language variant feature: 
   - some problematic thing with how lexicon lookups are performed.
   	 can't get agār from agar in liv, even though the analyser is working and
   	 returning results
   - detailed view needs redirecting
   - API lookup doesn't work yet

* POS needs to be selected by tagset always, not by being the first tag in
  order. reduces requirement that analyser have special tagsets itself

* test autocomplete filtering more

* need to hide 'more information' link when there isn't actually more information
  - kind of tricky to implement, the easy way might make things slower,
    but a more involved way just takes more thinking

* some tags are too long for the field, but overflow is hidden
  - f.eks.)
      http://localhost:5000/detail/sme/nob/goabbat%20guoibm%C3%A1me.html?no_compounds=true&lemma_match=true

     --
      pron. resipr. 1.p.tot. Acc/G ... 
     --

* need to recheck compounds and derivation filtering
  - build two new analysers, unchecked in patch in dictionary-include.am
    and Makefile.am seems to fix the issue

  - oahpásmahttit -> oahpásmuvvat

    $ lookup -flags mbTT analyser-dict-gt-norm.xfst

    oahpásmahttit   oahpásmuvvat+V+IV+Der/ahtti+V+Der/NomAg+N+Pl+Nom

 - but analyser-gt-norm probably has too much output or something to be used currently? 

* autocomplete needs to not collect entries that have til_ref;
  maybe this will be a language-specific setting

   - might be tricky, 'cause autocomplete is parsed before filters and
     such are read, perhaps better to just have an xpath string as a
     setting or something.

* hverandre and other stuff for the detailed view doesn't work

# General design stuff


  example from detailed view:
    - lexicon( xml -> parser )
                + language specific formatting (chance for markup)
    - 

    - user query -> view -> lexicon lookup results -> formatter ->
      view does some more things, sorting, object manipulation
      -> templates

    - templates obviously handle markup

  this is too much, but it happened because a lot of functionality was
  developed on the fly. now that all the needs from the lexicon and
  morphology are clear, it needs to be improved and simplified.

   - morphology needs:
     - 

   - lexicon needs:

     - lexicon-specific formatting must be turned into something the
     application can display.

     - lexicon-specific tags must be turned into something morphology
     can operate on without much effort from a programmer

     - room for entry/word-class specific formatting stuff

   - linguist needs:

     - choose how to display a specific entry type based on knowledge of
       lexicon and morphology, without much effort from the programmer

        - pos=N, type=Prop and has @reg; -> display l/text() with l/@reg
        - pos=N, type=Prop and has @reg; -> display l/text() with l/@reg


     - able to programmatically define links to other entries

     - able to define what paradigm to generate and show with the entry
       - interact with morphology and tags without having to know how
         all the (python) code works

## 

 1.) define connections between morphology and lexicon
     - what tags and attributes differ, and how should they be used to
       look up a word
     - define tag sets so that they may be used in rules
     - define alphabetic order for language
     - 

 2.) define how lexicon entries are displayed to users, based on entry
     and morphology attributes

     - capability to also add links to different entries
     - when to hide morphological results
     - when to hide tag pieces from users if they can't be altered in the morph.

 3.) define what forms are generated for the entry type

 4.) define how tags should be shown to users-- translation to localisation langs

... Also this should all be central and easy to find. Also, what happens when
the lexicon is a TSV?

# Misc

 * update reversed to work with new structures -> fin-kpv

 * ie8 rendering bug on flag lists in header on main page, but not on about page

 * detail view, include generation info in opt+shift+? debug

 * See bugs 
 
 * change cache settings for plugin js in nginx configs, some browsers are
   unwilling to get a new version even when it exists.

 * test remaining browser notes

 * refresh settings button in plugin

 * jspwiki generator for sphinx

 * cakefile include build bookmark.min.js

 * other dictionaries page, listing links to other groups
 
 * autocomplete parse only once per file

 * a little advertising and such for the reader and page with content in specific languages 
   see script in misc/o

   Add text to reader page: "Here are the top websites that people are reading, did you know you can read them too?"

  For privacy concerns, only include top _domains_ not individual pages. Also,
  split these out by language pair used in the lookup. above list is just
  everything in access logs.

## post launch TODOs:

 * bookmark icon for iOS

    /apple-touch-icon-57x57-precomposed.png
    /apple-touch-icon-57x57.png 
    /apple-touch-icon-precomposed.png 
    /apple-touch-icon.png 

 * gtweb: certificates

 * translate the mobile bookmark bubble, maybe modify/write one for
   android, where the process is a little more complex
 
 * Link til read i selve ordbok-grensesnittet -- kor?
   -- "Vil du ha oversatt ord i en tekst?" 
   -- "Háliidatgo jorgalahttit sániid teavsttas?"
   -- "Haluatko käännöksen tekstissä esiintyvään sanaan?"

 * autocomplete SoMe variant

## Next:

 * Glossary page explaining each tag part. 

 * mobile menu language variant display (e.g. SoMe vs. Norm)

 * bookmarklet unload on additional click
   
 * word test-list - http://giellatekno.uit.no/doc/dicts/checklist.html

 * dropdown events on mobile are a bit funny for the menu on the
   detailed view, and it is impossible to select a new language pair

 * use logger's own log message formatter

 -- 

 * Once all this is together, optimize memory usage, with specific
   attention to gtlab / gtoahpa, may be a better way to have multiple
   threads/greenlets/etc running while parsing trees into only one
   thread.

   Note: http://blog.pythonisito.com/2012/07/gevent-and-greenlets.html

## Would be nice

 * Makefile: check which FST and lexica are updated on svn up, and then
   automatically rebuild all

 * developer- and linguist-friendly templates for editing how words are
  presented ; multimethods + jinja - prefer more templates instead of many
  if/else statements for attributes?

 * tagsets for selecting POS from analyses & specifying what parts of
   tags should be used for lookups, with fallbacks if they don't exist.
   (i.e., take POS and Valence if both exist in analysis, if only POS, use
   that)

   - sma: +1+V, +2+V; one fix is to remove from FST, so that +V is first
          element, other option would be to improve the lookup system.

   - maybe thinking about a solution to this will help generalise other
     things for more languages, allowing language-specific configuration
     of what elements from the analysis must be used to look up words in
     the lexicon

 * advanced search form: here we get to have some nerdy linguistic fun.

## Features to develop at some point:

 * Use something other than werkzeug's default cache

 * Maybe should provide an individual process for each language pair?
   Should be easy to split off new processes by pair/endpoint. Note also
   werkzeug DispatcherMiddleware and PathDispatcher:
   http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/patterns/appdispatch/

 * getting near the time to adapt version of lookupserv.py that is checked in
   for actual use. spawn it on process run, so that no one needs to think/worry
   that it exists aside from looking at process hierarchy in htop
