## Testing the NDS paradigm selection and generation machinery
## 

##
##   Here we test two main things: FST + NDS interactions, and NDS
## rendering. Any tests that can be seen to be only for FSTs should be
## left in the langs infrastructure.
##
##   NDS + FST interactions:
##    
##    - Generation of paradigms corresponding to specific lexical
##      entries
##
##    - Analysis of wordforms resulting in entries
##       - has entry
##       - does not have entry
##   
##  NDS rendering:
##   
##    - Lookup pages
##    - Regeneration of analyzed wordforms

# Given a uri, test that `expected_values` occur within a list generated
# by `value_selector`. uri_args are formatted into the uri for each
# test.
# 
# This could be used for writing a test to check that the basic lookup
# page is returning canonical forms in the analysis side, checking that
# localization renders, etc.
#

RequestTests:

 # This searches the analyses on the side to confirm that all options
 # are present

 - uri: "/crk/eng/?lookup=%(input)s"
   tests:

# interface. Analyzes the input form, and generates returned lemmas,
