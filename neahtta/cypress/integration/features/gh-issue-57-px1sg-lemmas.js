/**
 * Nouns with OBLIGATORY POSSESSION and cannot have "unspecified
 * possessor" ("non-PxX nouns") should link to their lemma, which is in the
 * first-person possessor form ("Px1Sg").
 *
 * For example, "kôhkom" is *your* grandmother. There can't just be a 
 * "grandmother"; she has to be my grandmother, your grandmother, or their
 * grandmother! These are non-PxX nouns.
 *
 * Historically, we'd present non-PxX nouns as the stem, and link to the
 * Px1Sg form of the noun with a <lemma_ref> element in the dictionary, but
 * this turns out to be inelegant.
 *
