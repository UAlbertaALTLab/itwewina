* sound files in itwêwina are not playing, problem appears to be URLs
  - JS dependencies were missing on sapir, fixed now
  - TODO: ffmpeg on sapir, audio files not being transcoded and thus not
    found

* Identify itwêwina-specific features and implement them for guusaaw,
  kidwinan and gunaha
   - korp integration
     - TODO: which langs?
   - audio_links.template
     - TODO: which langs?
   - analyses contain root (maybe for odawa?)
     - TODO: roots need to be in the lexicon for this to work, could
       enable feature if this is the plan otherwise
   - about.template
     - TODO: copy for each project so that relevant examples can be
       added

   - relabel settings
     - DONE: added basic files
   - keyboard input
     - DONE: add as a comment, antti can add letters
   - entry_text.template: include PoS and inflectional type from lc
     - DONE: kidwinan - conditional, so only displayed if not the same
     - DONE: gunaha (in the lexicon?)
   - paradigm CSS fixes
     - DONE: kidwinan, gunaha, guusaaw
   - paradigm layouts
     - DONE: this is available for all langs now, just need to add
       templates (for linguists to do)
   - sources.template
     - DONE: copied
   - hide text "possible form of ... "
     - DONE: added setting in template_settings.html

* kidwinan/otw - glossing FSTs going away?

* linguists: add sources to various project sources templates
* linguists: add paradigms and layouts

* Lexicon result sorting for itwêwina
  - some of this is carried out in definition template, which sorts
    meanings by @rank


Done
* FSTs: capitalization: Xaní and xaní should both be recognized as lemma
  xaní; orthographical capitalization on first word of sentence, etc

* the reader icon is coming from localizations, which is resulting in
  the wrong symbol rendering. move it to YAML ReaderConfig settings

* add UofA logos to kidwinan and gunaha

* itwêwina, generalizing lemma recognition etc seems to be including the
  full lemma in the analysis view, so: 

    ← mowêw + √mow- + Verb + ...

  instead of

    ← √mow- + Verb + ...

* crk occasionally redirects to wrong urls /crk/eng/ after form submission, some weird cache interaction
  1. mobile layout doesn't seem to have url_for yet
    - problem was missing url_for on mobile redirect
  2. when landing at /itwewina/ from elsewhere, sometimes /itwewina/ isn't
     included on first search, check referrer handling
* gunaha [] deletion (check infra)
* fix DSt cache location in JS, seems to be using itwewina for gunaha, etc.
  - not the problem, problem was updating config files
* srs localization for Á character
* gunaha spell relax - implemented mobile spellrelax, uncertain how to get
  normal one included?
