* FSTs: capitalization: Xaní and xaní should both be recognized as lemma xaní; orthographical capitalization on first word of sentence, etc
* itwêwina, generalizing lemma recognition etc seems to be including the
  full lemma in the analysis view, so: 

    ← mowêw + √mow- + Verb + ...

  instead of

    ← √mow- + Verb + ...

* the reader icon is coming from localizations, which is resulting in
  the wrong symbol rendering. move it to YAML ReaderConfig settings

* add UofA logos to kidwinan and gunaha

* sound files in itwêwina are not playing, problem appears to be URLs

* Identify itwêwina-specific features and implement them for guusaaw,
  kidwinan and gunaha

* Lexicon result sorting for itwêwina

* itwewina reduplication broken, but in FST?
* tsídiitł'á, nàgudiitłod, ts'ázid - problem with extra i being added somewhere, linguists
  need to look

Done
* crk occasionally redirects to wrong urls /crk/eng/ after form submission, some weird cache interaction
  1. mobile layout doesn't seem to have url_for yet
    - problem was missing url_for on mobile redirect
  2. when landing at /itwewina/ from elsewhere, sometimes /itwewina/ isn't
     included on first search, check referrer handling
* gunaha [] deletion (check infra)
* fix DSt cache location in JS, seems to be using itwewina for gunaha, etc.
  - not the problem, problem was updating config files
* srs localization for Á character
* gunaha spell relax - implemented mobile spellrelax, uncertain how to get
  normal one included?
