* Identify itwêwina-specific features and implement them for guusaaw,
  kidwinan and gunaha
   - TODO: crk.py
   - korp integration
     - TODO: which langs?
   - audio_links.template
     - TODO: integrate with parent templates
   - analyses contain root
     - TODO: roots need to be in the lexicon for this to work, could
       enable feature if this is the plan otherwise

* linguists: add sources to various project sources templates
* linguists: add paradigms and layouts

* Lexicon result sorting for itwêwina
  - some of this is carried out in definition template, which sorts
    meanings by @rank
* kidwinan/otw - glossing FSTs going away?

                sudo apt-get install libmp3lame-dev

                --enable-libmp3lame

                sudo apt-get install autoconf automake build-essential libass-dev libfreetype6-dev \
                    libtheora-dev libtool libvorbis-dev pkg-config texinfo zlib1g-dev

                sudo apt-get install yasm

        config options i used:

            PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH" PKG_CONFIG_PATH="$HOME/ffmpeg_build/lib/pkgconfig" ./configure \
              --prefix="$HOME/ffmpeg_build" \
              --pkg-config-flags="--static" \
              --extra-cflags="-I$HOME/ffmpeg_build/include" \
              --extra-ldflags="-L$HOME/ffmpeg_build/lib" \

              --enable-libtheora \
              --enable-libvorbis \
              --enable-nonfree

    - soundmanager problems: problem was that links contain <span>, and
      click target is sometimes <span />, sometimes <a />, fixed in
      sound_links.js

* FSTs: capitalization: Xaní and xaní should both be recognized as lemma
  xaní; orthographical capitalization on first word of sentence, etc

* the reader icon is coming from localizations, which is resulting in
  the wrong symbol rendering. move it to YAML ReaderConfig settings

* add UofA logos to kidwinan and gunaha

* itwêwina, generalizing lemma recognition etc seems to be including the
  full lemma in the analysis view, so: 

    ← mowêw + √mow- + Verb + ...

  instead of

    ← √mow- + Verb + ...

* crk occasionally redirects to wrong urls /crk/eng/ after form submission, some weird cache interaction
  1. mobile layout doesn't seem to have url_for yet
    - problem was missing url_for on mobile redirect
  2. when landing at /itwewina/ from elsewhere, sometimes /itwewina/ isn't
     included on first search, check referrer handling
* gunaha [] deletion (check infra)
* fix DSt cache location in JS, seems to be using itwewina for gunaha, etc.
  - not the problem, problem was updating config files
* srs localization for Á character
* gunaha spell relax - implemented mobile spellrelax, uncertain how to get
  normal one included?
