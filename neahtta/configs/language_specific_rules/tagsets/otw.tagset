# `pos` values must be whatever is in both the lexicon and the FST in order for
# dictionary lookups based on the morphology to check POS as well.
#
# Anything in a tagset here will be used to pull the lemma out of an analysis, 
# so if tags come before the lemma, e.g., 1+mkizin+NI, they must be listed
# below in some set.
