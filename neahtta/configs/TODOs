TODO: this directory and subdirectories shouldn't be python modules, so
that it's possible to specify the path to config files on a
project-to-project basis. Eventually these configs should be moved
elsewhere, outside of the nds source directory

    - __init__.py functionality of searching for config files should be
      moved elsewhere to part of config.py, nothing for module/blueprint
      setup within configs/
    - all paths mentioning language_specific_rules need to be redone so
      that the path can be set in project config .yaml optionally
    - actual config python code needs to be modularized too, move stuff
      to `conf/` to split things up

TODO: set up an example, completely default config directory with one or
two values here and there, and find a way to make everything run with
completely default or unset options.

rationale here is: using NDS outside of GT infrastructure should be
possible, so that NDS source code can be packaged without reference to
all of the projects we're running within the infra.

ISO.py files still require access to common via import, so this
directory still needs module structure to run, however for new projects
using their own config directories without overrides this isn't yet a
problem

DONE: language_names.py -> language_names.yaml; localization strings now
migrated to use these paths, values in this file are available on the config
object
