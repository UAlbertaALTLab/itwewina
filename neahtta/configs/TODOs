TODO: this directory and subdirectories shouldn't be python modules, so
that it's possible to specify the path to config files on a
project-to-project basis. Eventually these configs should be moved
elsewhere, outside of the nds source directory

    - __init__.py functionality of searching for config files should be
      moved elsewhere to part of config.py, nothing for module/blueprint
      setup within configs/
    - all paths mentioning language_specific_rules need to be redone so
      that the path can be set in project config .yaml optionally
    - actual config python code needs to be modularized too, move stuff
      to `conf/` to split things up

TODO: set up an example, completely default config directory with one or
two values here and there, and find a way to make everything run with
completely default or unset options.

rationale here is: using NDS outside of GT infrastructure should be
possible, so that NDS source code can be packaged without reference to
all of the projects we're running within the infra.

DONE: language_names.py -> language_names.yaml; localization strings now
migrated to use these paths, values in this file are available on the config
object
