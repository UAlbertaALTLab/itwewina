# For default locals, these must correspond with what exists in the

# format.

# Some helpful aliases for paths below.
Tools:
  xfst_lookup: &LOOKUP '/usr/bin/lookup'
  opt: &OPT '/opt/smi'

# Note that YAML doesn't support concatenating strings directly, 
# so in this case I use list notation. See the examples below.
#
# To avoid repeating, feel free to set aliases for things like
# shared FST format settings (as demonstrated with `&sme_fst_options` and 
# `<<: *sme_fst_options`. This is a YAML alias pattern.

Morphology:
  # This is the default setup for sme.

# Here are the actual definitions of what dictionaries are available in the
