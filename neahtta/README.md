## Overview

A service using the [Flask][1] framework to serve up dictionary entries
using XML lexica and morphological analyzer services. Returns data in
JSON, and some HTML.

 [1]: http://flask.pocoo.org/

For more information on package dependencies, see `requirements.txt`.

## Installing

You need:

  - Python 2.7.12, with Python virtualenv
  - [Node.JS][]

### Python

Use [virtualenv][venv] to create an environment with requirements.txt.
The virtualenv could really go anywhere, but a common convention is to save it
in the local directory so that you always know where it is.

    virtualenv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt

Additional dependencies that you may need while developing NDS/itwêwina are in
`requirements_dev.txt`:

    pip install -r requirements_dev.txt

If more requirements become necessary, be sure to update the file and check it
in.

    pip freeze > requirements.txt

Update [Babel][]'s locale data. Babel probably will not have locales
created for 'crk' or its written variants. On Sapir, existing locales are
located here:

    /srv/apps/nds/babel_locales/crk.dat
    /srv/apps/nds/babel_locales/crk_Macr.dat
    /srv/apps/nds/babel_locales/crk_Syll.dat

As a sloppy workaround, if you don't have access to these, you can copy the
locales for `en_CA.bin`, located in your virtualenv:

    .venv/lib/python2.7/site-packages/babel/locale-data/en_CA.dat

Copy the needed locales to the your virtualenv.

    cp /srv/apps/nds/babel_locales/crk*.dat .venv/lib/python2.7/site-packages/babel/locale-data/

[Babel]: http://babel.pocoo.org/en/latest/index.html
[venv]: http://www.virtualenv.org/

### Node.JS

Install [Node.JS], however is most convenient for your system.

Now, install neahtta's additional dependencies:

    npm install

[Node.JS]: https://nodejs.org


### Generating the secret key/token

The secret key is required for session storage in Flask.

To generate `secret_key.do.not.check.in`, use a cryptographically secure random
number generator. You can use the included script that will do this for you:

    python generate_key.py > secret_key.do.not.check.in


## The FSTs and the dictionaries

Make sure you copy the latest FSTs and dictionaries to the appropriate places.

What I do is copy all the dictionaries (XML files) from the server's copy of
itwêwina to my local copy:

    scp sapir.artsrn.ualberta.ca:/data/exps/itwewina/neahtta/dicts/*.xml dicts/

As for the FSTs, ask Antti (or me, Eddie) where the latest FSTs are, and copy
them somewhere accessible. On Sapir, this is

    /home/ARTSRN/easantos/crk-fsts

You will need configure this directory in `configs/itwewina.config.yml`. See
later for "Configuration".

## Running the development server

Activate the virtualenv, then:

    fab itwewina runserver

Replace "itwewina" with the specific instance you need.


## Testing

This project uses [cypress.io][] for in-browser (integration) tests.

If you just want to run the tests, do the following:

    fab itwewina integration_tests

If you are developing new tests or features, do the following:

First, start the development server (see above). It should be accessible at
<http://localhost:5000/itwewina/>.

Assuming you already ran `npm install`, you should be able to run the UI tests
with the following command:

    npm test

**Note**: You probably need an up-to-date browser for this to work. On my
machine, this starts up a new Google Chrome 67 window and does all its testing
in there.

If you want to write tests interactively, use Cypress's dashboard:

    npm run cypress:open

For help with writing new tests, follow the [Cypress test writing
guide][cypress-guide].

[cypress.io]: https://www.cypress.io/
[cypress-guide]: https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/writing-your-first-test.html


## Deployment

Always merge code you want to deploy into the `development` branch.
Then use the following command:

    fab sapir itwewina ship_it

This runs the integration tests (see [Testing]). Once the test pass,
this updates the `sapir` branch to be up-to-date with development, and the
pushes the newly updated branch to GitHub. Then it pulls the changes on Sapir,
including installing any new requirements and restarts the `mod_wsgi` server.

If you just want to pull the latest changes from the `sapir` branch, you can use
this instead:

    fab sapir itwewina deploy

The code runs within [mod_wsgi].

[mod_wsgi]: http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/deploying/mod_wsgi/

Copy `itwewina.wsgi.template` to `itwewina.wsgi` and customize it as required,
following the documentation for both Flask and [mod_wsgi].


## Loose documentation

I wrote this documentation as I was setting up the new deployment of itwêwina on
Sapir. It is not very well edited :/

### Lexical and linguistic dependencies to check

You should have the dictionaries in `/dict` and models in `/opt/smi/{lang}/src`
(where `{lang}` is a language ISO code).

 * svn up main/words/dicts/
 * svn up main/gt/
 * svn up main/langs

#### Makefile

The Makefile in `neahtta/dicts/` can be used to generate dictionary XML files,
and also to compile and manage the installation of FSTs and other morphologies.

See `make help` for more information.

## Developing

### Module-specific documentation.

For Python-module specific documentation, see the docstrings available in the
individual Python files. A short overview follows:

 * `neahtta.py` - initialization of Flask app, endpoints.
 * `config.py` and `configs/` - app configuration, yaml parsing, and yaml files
 * `configs/language_specific_rules` - directory for storing language-specific
   display, morphology and lexicon overrides.
 * `configs/language_names.py` - ISO names and 2-char -> 3-char definitions
 * `translations/` - i18n/i10n/localization details and .po files.
 * `lexicon/` - XML parsing
 * `morphology/` - FST parsing, lemmatization modules
 * `morpholex/` - Thing that ties these two together
 * `static/` - js, css, img, etc.
 * `templates/` - jinja2 templates for endpoints.
 * `dicts/` - path where XML files are typically stored

### XML format

See <https://github.com/UAlbertaALTLab/itwewina/blob/development/docs/xml-dictionary.md>
